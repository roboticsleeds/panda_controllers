# Panda Controllers


This repository implements a variety of feedback controllers for the Franka-Emika Panda using franka_ros.

## Inverse Dynamics Controller
An Inverse dynamics controller computes desired joint torques based on a desired acceleration
and the discrepancy between actual and desired positions and velocities.

The controller is broken down into the two following stages, firstly a feedforward acceleration
term is computed:

```math
\begin{align}
\ddot{\textbf{q}}_{ff} = \ddot{\textbf{q}}_{desired} + \textbf{K}_p(\textbf{q}_{desired} - \textbf{q}_{actual}) + \textbf{K}_d(\dot{\textbf{q}}_{desired} - \dot{\textbf{q}}_{actual})
\end{align}
```

where the feedforward acceleration and desired positions and velocities are the commands sent to the controller. The actual positions
and velocities are obtained from the real robot state. The desired acceleration is used with the robot inverse dynamics formula to compute
torques:

```math
\begin{align}
\tau = M(\textbf{q}_{actual}) \ddot{\textbf{q}}_{ff} + C(\textbf{q}_{actual}, \dot{\textbf{q}}_{actual}) \dot{\textbf{q}}_{actual} + G(\textbf{q}_{actual})
\end{align}
```
### Usage

To use this controller, simply clone this repository in franka_ros and then make sure that the controller is loaded. For example,
you can add the following text to the default_controllers.yaml file in the `franka_ros/franka_control/config` directory:

```
panda_inverse_dynamics_controller:
  type: "panda_controllers/InverseDynamicsController"
  joint_names:
        - panda_joint1
        - panda_joint2
        - panda_joint3
        - panda_joint4
        - panda_joint5
        - panda_joint6
        - panda_joint7
  p_gains:
        - 300.0
        - 300.0
        - 300.0
        - 300.0
        - 150.0
        - 100.0
        - 150.0
  d_gains:
        - 40.0
        - 40.0
        - 40.0
        - 40.0
        - 20.0
        - 20.0
        - 10.0
```

The gain values are specified in the YAML file. These are the values I have found to work well so far.

## PD+Feedforward Controller

A PD+Feedforward controller computes torques to send to the robot in a single step by considering a feedforward
torque term and the deviations between desired and actual positions and velocities.

```math
\begin{align}
\tau = \tau_{desired} + \textbf{K}_p(\textbf{q}_{desired} - \textbf{q}_{actual}) + \textbf{K}_d(\dot{\textbf{q}}_{desired} - \dot{\textbf{q}}_{actual})
\end{align}
```

## QP Tracking Controller

To be implemented still

## To Do
- [ ] Implement safety features for commanded velocity and make sure commanded positions are within joint limits
